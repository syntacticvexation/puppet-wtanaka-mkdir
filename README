This module defines a custom function
all_parents() which you can use to create a
directory and all of its ancestors simultaneously.

Example:
(creates a symbolic link from /some/path/to/a/file
pointing at /vagrant)

$path = '/some/path/to/a/file'
$path_parents = all_parents($path) 
file { $path_to_project_parents:
  ensure => 'directory',
  mode => 775,
}
file { $path_to_project:
  ensure => 'link',
  target => '/vagrant',
}
